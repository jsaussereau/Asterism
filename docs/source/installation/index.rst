Installation
============

**Odatix** can be installed in several ways. 

For standard use, the preferred option is installation from PyPI. 

For developers looking to modify Odatix, it can be installed from the source code. 
Additionally, it is possible to use Odatix without installing it by running it directly from the source code using the ``run_odatix.py`` and ``run_odatix_explorer.py`` scripts.
