Quick Start
===========

The easiest way to learn how to use Odatix is by exploring the integrated examples.

Here are two tutorials depending on you want to try first:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:
    
    fmax_synthesis
    simulations


.. grid::

    .. grid-item-card:: Try parallel Fmax synthesis
        :link: fmax_synthesis.html
        :text-align: center

        Run parallel Fmax synthesis flow on the EDA tool and technological target of your choice (FGPA or ASIC)

    .. grid-item-card:: Try parallel simulations
        :link: simulations.html
        :text-align: center

        Run parallel simulations on the simulator of your choice

If you would like to try Odatix Explorer without running all configurations, you can try it online with sample results:

.. card:: Try Odatix Explorer Online
   :margin: auto
   :width: 50%

   Please note the deployment server can take up to a minute to start. Running Odatix Explorer locally is much faster. Thank you for your patience.
